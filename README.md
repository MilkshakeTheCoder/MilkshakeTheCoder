# Hi, Im MilkshakeTheCoder!

- 👋 I'm working on new Discord Bots and learning python better as a whole.
- 👀 I’m interested in Discord Bots, parsing, python, web-hosting, mongodb, youtube, and video games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and connection to github and mongodb. (also how to fancy-up README.md files)
- 💞️ I’m collaborating on [Cafe_Bot](https://github.com/MilkshakeTheCoder/Cafe_Bot) with [andrewthederp](https://github.com/andrewthederp).
- 📫 How to reach me: Make an issue on one of my github repositories.
